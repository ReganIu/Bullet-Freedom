PROJECT TITLE: Bullet Hell Freedom

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create a fun and creative game using the lessons we learned throughout the year. This project specifically focuses on the use of 2D arrays. The objective of the game
is to make a level to your liking and then try to clear it without getting hit 3 times!

VERSION or DATE: January 18, 2018


HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Press the play button to play the game

AUTHORS: Cody Chiu, Jonah Reeves, Regan Iu





USER INSTRUCTIONS - BUILDING: 
1. Once the game begins, the user will have to design their own bullet hell level, made up of a maximum of 9 enemies per wave and 9 waves per level.
2. Click on the screen to place an enemy where you would wish it to spawn, to change which actor is placed, click on the template actors at the bottom of the screen. Note each enemy has a
different movement and attack pattern. The more basic enemies are on the left, getting harder moving towards the right of the list.
3. Once you have filled the screen with enemies to your liking, press the space bar to save the current wave and begin working on the next wave.
4. When you have filled all the waves you desire, press enter to begin the game.

USER INSTRUCTIONS - PLAYING:
1. Your character (the spaceship) has a full range of movement along with two abilities, shoot and super
2. You may shoot with the spacebar, if the bullet hits an enemy, the enemy will die. 
3. To use your super ability, it must be fully charged. The super ability meter is located on the left. Every time you hit an enemy, the super meter will increase. Once it is fully charged,
press control to use it. Note that the super ability has a chance to destroy the enemy fire it comes in contact with, almost like a get out of jail free card.
4. When you get hit, your ship will turn red and you will lose one life. You will be invulnerable until your ship turns white again (3 seconds). If you run out of lives, the game will end.
5. Once all your waves have been completed, a boss will spawn. The boss' life bar will be located mirrored to the special bar. The boss has multiple attacks. If you defeat the boss, you have
successfully cleared your level!
